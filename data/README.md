# Trajectory Data and Visualization

This directory contains trajectory data for a 3-DOF robotic arm and a Python script to visualize the data.

## Files

- `semi_circle_trajectory_kp0.10_kd0.4_r0.10_x0.25_z0.10_semicircle3_20250724_140439.csv`: A CSV file containing the trajectory data. The filename includes the controller gains (`kp`, `kd`), the radius of the semi-circle, and the center coordinates (`x`, `z`).
- `visualize_trajectory.py`: A Python script to visualize the trajectory data from the CSV file. It generates plots for the end-effector trajectory, position error, joint angles, velocities, accelerations, and torques.
- `plot.png`: An example plot generated by the visualization script.

## CSV File Columns

The CSV file contains the following columns:

| Column Name           | Description                                                 |

| `radius`              | The radius of the semi-circle trajectory.                   |
| `center_x`            | The x-coordinate of the center of the semi-circle.          |
| `center_z`            | The z-coordinate of the center of the semi-circle.          |

## Visualization Script

The `visualize_trajectory.py` script can be run to generate interactive plots of the trajectory data. The script will automatically detect all `.csv` files in the directory and prompt the user to select one for visualization. The script generates the following plots:

- End-Effector Trajectory
- Position Error
- Joint Angles
- Joint Velocities
- Joint Accelerations
- Joint Torques
