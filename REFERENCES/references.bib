   abstract = {Inverse design arises in a variety of areas in engineering such as acoustic, mechanics, thermal/electronic transport, electromagnetism, and optics. Topology optimization is a major form of inverse design, where we optimize a designed geometry to achieve targeted properties and the geometry is parameterized by a density function. This optimization is challenging, because it has a very high dimensionality and is usually constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) and additional inequalities. Here, we propose a new deep learning method -- physics-informed neural networks with hard constraints (hPINNs) -- for solving topology optimization. hPINN leverages the recent development of PINNs for solving PDEs, and thus does not rely on any numerical PDE solver. However, all the constraints in PINNs are soft constraints, and hence we impose hard constraints by using the penalty method and the augmented Lagrangian method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hPINN for a holography problem in optics and a fluid problem of Stokes flow. We achieve the same objective as conventional PDE-constrained optimization methods based on adjoint methods and numerical PDE solvers, but find that the design obtained from hPINN is often simpler and smoother for problems whose solution is not unique. Moreover, the implementation of inverse design with hPINN can be easier than that of conventional methods.},

   abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been popularized as a deep learning framework that can seamlessly synthesize observational data and partial differential equation (PDE) constraints.

In this paper we present a series of best practices that can significantly improve the training efficiency and overall accuracy of PINNs. We also put forth a series of challenging benchmark problems that highlight some of the most prominent difficulties in training PINNs, and present comprehensive and fully reproducible ablation studies that demonstrate how different architecture choices and training strategies affect the test accuracy of the resulting models. We show that the methods and guiding principles put forth in this study lead to state-of-the-art results and provide strong baselines that future studies should use for comparison purposes. To this end, we also release a highly optimized library in JAX that can be used to reproduce all results reported in this paper, enable future research studies, as well as facilitate easy adaptation to new use-case scenarios.},

   abstract = {Collaborative robots have promising potential for widespread use in small-and-medium-sized enterprise (SME) manufacturing and production due to the development of increasingly sophisticated Human-Robot Collaboration technologies. However, predicting and identifying the behavior of collaborative robots remains a challenging problem due to the significant non-linear properties of their unique gearbox, the harmonic drive. To tackle the engineering problem, this work proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics. The procedure involves deriving the state-space dynamic model, embedding the system's dynamics into a recurrent neural network (RNN) with customized Runge-Kutta cells, obtaining labeled training data, predicting system responses, and estimating dynamic parameters. The proposed method is applied to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics, and the results are verified and validated through numerical simulations and experimental testing, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate a high level of agreement with the ground truth and exhibit superior performance compared to the conventional PINN and the non-linear grey-box state-space estimation algorithm when confronted with non-linearity and dynamic coupling. Moreover, the PINN exhibits the potential for extension to various dynamic systems.},

   abstract = {In the field of robotic modelling, the challenge of parameter estimation using limited joint monitoring data presents a substantial hurdle for both traditional physics-based methods (PBMs) and machine learning (ML) techniques. PBMs grapple with modelling uncertainties, variable working conditions, diverse robotic configurations, and incomplete parameter information. ML methods face hurdles in maintaining physical consistency, interpretability, and the need for extensive training data. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach, the Equation Embedded Neural Network (E2NN), enhanced by an innovative Liquid mechanism, which effectively blends the strengths of PBMs and ML to surmount their inherent limitations. Its primary contributions encompass: (1) a pioneering review and synthesis of hybrid frameworks integrating physical principles with ML, (2) the development and rigorous validation of the E2NN framework, and (3) the introduction of a novel physics regulator and dynamic Liquid mechanism. Particularly, the proposed E2NN leverages inverse dynamics equations to construct specialized neural network layers, featuring activation functions and interconnections expressed as composition operators, thus explicitly encoding physical knowledge. This architectural choice proves especially well-suited for tasks involving inverse dynamics and dynamic planning of robotic manipulators. The accompanying Liquid mechanism allows for dynamic adaptation of interlayer connections in response to input data, enabling real-time adjustments to changing inputs and equations of motion, ultimately enhancing flexibility and performance. Quantitative assessments of E2NN reveal its compelling performance, yielding a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.10716, closely aligned with the Benchmark Deep Residual Shrinkage Network's (DRSN) MAE of 0.10415, showcasing its competitive efficacy while achieving higher computational efficiency and a more compact model size. Robustness evaluations further confirm E2NN's adaptability, as it attains a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.3, outperforming DRSN's 1.1 under varying working conditions. E2NN excels in torque trajectory fitting, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 97.1%, underscoring its practical effectiveness. Furthermore, E2NN excels in torque prediction and parameter identification for inverse dynamics models, particularly when confronted with limited joint data and variable friction conditions. It substantially improving the discernment of robot dynamics and enhancing its applicability in real-world trajectory fitting.},

   abstract = {Accurate models of the world are built upon notions of its underlying symmetries. In physics, these symmetries correspond to conservation laws, such as for energy and momentum. Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a promising tool to approximate (partial) differential equations. PINNs are not suited for control tasks in their original form since they are not designed to handle variable control actions or variable initial values. We thus present the idea of enhancing PINNs by adding control actions and initial conditions as additional network inputs. The high-dimensional input space is subsequently reduced via a sampling strategy and a zero-hold assumption. This strategy enables the controller design based on a PINN as an approximation of the underlying system dynamics. The additional benefit is that the sensitivities are easily computed via automatic differentiation, thus leading to efficient gradient-based algorithms. Finally, we present our results using our PINN-based MPC to solve a tracking problem for a complex mechanical system, a multi-link manipulator.},

   abstract = {Learning the inverse dynamics of robots directly from data, adopting a black-box approach, is interesting for several real-world scenarios where limited knowledge about the system is available. In this article, we propose a black-box model based on Gaussian process (GP) regression for the identification of the inverse dynamics of robotic manipulators. The proposed model relies on a novel multidimensional kernel, called Lagrangian Inspired Polynomial (LIP) kernel. The LIP kernel is based on two main ideas. First, instead of directly modeling the inverse dynamics components, we model as GPs the kinetic and potential energy of the system. The GP prior on the inverse dynamics components is derived from those on the energies by applying the properties of GPs under linear operators. Second, as regards the energy prior definition, we prove a polynomial structure of the kinetic and potential energy, and we derive a polynomial kernel that encodes this property. As a consequence, the proposed model allows also to estimate the kinetic and potential energy without requiring any label on these quantities. Results on simulation and on two real robotic manipulators, namely a 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda, and a 6 DOF MELFA RV4FL, show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art black-box estimators based both on Gaussian processes and neural networks in terms of accuracy, generality, and data efficiency. The experiments on the MELFA robot also demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned model-based estimators, despite requiring less prior information. The code of the proposed model is publicly available.},
